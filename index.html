        <h2><span>About Me</span></h2>
       
        <p>Once you’ve developed recipes that you’re confident in and you know your customers enjoy, be consistent with them. It might be fun for you to add a different spice or try something new, but a customer who’s expecting a dish to taste the way it has in the past is going to be disappointed if his expectations aren’t met.Customers are very important to me.so We place a lot of emphasis on guest-driven decisions.We recently replaced our standard ice machines with ‘chewable’ ice machines after guests requested chewable ice.</p>
